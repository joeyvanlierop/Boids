## About The Project

Developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, boids are a form of artificial life that mimic the flocking behaviour of birds. Boids are able to form beautiful, mesmerizing patterns by following these three rules: 
- Separation: Steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
- Alignment: Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
- Cohesion: Steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
